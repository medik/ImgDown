ImgDown - A image downloader
----------------------------

When I programmed this program the first time I used this to 
download multiple images from image bulletin and websites with
a lot of pictures. The intend remains today and you can use my
tool to do the same thing - Even if it isn't neccesery pictures
you're after. 

Instead to make a separate script for every web page structure,
I wanted to make a general solutions for every webpages. 

Install
-------
sudo apt-get install ruby ruby-all-dev ruby-curb
sudo gem install nokogiri trollop curb

Usage
-----

To get all links and pictures from a webpage, just type:
./imgdown --link http://link/to/webpage

This works for https links as well.
./imgdown --link https://link/to/webpage

To specify with regex, type:
./imgdown --link http://link/to/weboage --reg-ex "catpictures[0-9]+\.jpe?g"

Found a range of picture you want to download? Download with:
./imgdown --link http://link/to/weboage --reg-ex "catpictures[0-9]+\.jpe?g" --download

You might want to specify location.. 
./imgdown --link http://link/to/weboage --reg-ex "catpictures[0-9]+\.jpe?g" --download --destination "~/mycatpictures"

The website didn't want you to download your catpictures? Hehehe..
./imgdown --link http://link/to/weboage --reg-ex "catpictures[0-9]+\.jpe?g" --download --destination "~/mycatpictures" --user-agent "Catfox v.1337"

You're a person who forgets a lot?
./imgdown --help
